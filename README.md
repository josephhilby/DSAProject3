## About The Project
<div align="center">
  
</div>

This project serves as the capstone for University of Florida's Data Structures and Algorithms class (COP3530).

In this project we worked in teams of 3 students to create a project pitch to compare two algorithms on a data set of over 100,000 items. Our group elected to create a software that would compare two micromouse algorithms "Flood Fill" and "Wall Follow"
